<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About

This is an screenshot of the first page of the pdf that described the challenge: <br><br>
<img src="img/assignmentSS.png" alt="You are to create a “Team Members” page for a website. A data access API endpoint is provided (second page), but a web client is needed to access the API and render the data onto a webpage. The initial wireframe is flexible, however, the desktop version for each employee should look similar to the following layout. Use only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to complete the task. No helper functions, libraries, or frameworks are allowed!" width="400"><br>

## Requirements

Gleaned from the pdf:
<ul>
  <li>Single page website.</li>
  <li>Title: Team Members</li>
  <li>Panel for each member should look like moockup.</li>
  <li>Panel details:
    <ul>
      <li>Crown for featured employee.</li>
      <li>Each role should have a different colour.</li>
      <li>Circle-cropped image.</li>
      <li>Name as heading.</li>
      <li>Bio below name.</li>
      <li>Roles at the bottom.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Vanilla js, html, and css.</li>
  <li>End points suggest that the roles might be clickable, and lead to a second page with only employees with a given role.</li>
  <li>End points also suggest a page that allows the user to select multpile roles and show all employees with those roles.</li>
</ul>


## Reflection Questions

* What are your initial thoughts of the Coding Interview Challenge?
* What's your plan to approach it?
* How long do you imagine each step taking?
* What ended up being the actual process vs. your planned process?
* What could you do to improve?

My initial thoughts are that it seems quite involved. I understand the need to evaluate the abilities of a job candidate, but anything that would take more than 2-3 hours seems a bit excessive. I would only give this much of my time to an interview challenge if it was my ultimate dream job.

My approach will be roughly this:

<ol>
  <li>Determine requirements.</li>
  <li>Set up some code so that I can access the API and get a look at the available data.</li>
  <li>Static html and css.</li>
  <li>JS to dynamically render repeating elements.</li>
  <li>Testing.</li>
  <li>Documentation.
  <li>Additional features, depending on time.</li>
</ol>

Time estimates:
<ol>
  <li>Requirements: 1 hour</li>
  <li>API and data: 2 hours</li>
  <li>Html and css: 2 hours</li>
  <li>JS: 2 hours</li>
  <li>Testing: 1 hour</li>
  <li>Documentation: .5 hours</li>
</ol>

Total: 8.5 hours

Actual time:
<ol>
  <li>Requirements: .5 hours</li>
  <li>API and data: 2 hours</li>
  <li>Html and css: 1.25 hours</li>
  <li>JS: 1 hour</li>
  <li>Testing: .25 hours</li>
  <li>Documentation: .5 hours</li>
</ol>

Total: 5.5 hours

My process ended up following my plan pretty closely, except that I had done the work investigating the API before determining my requirements, which led me to think that the challenge was more difficult than it really was. If I had assessed the requirements first, it probably would have taken only 3-4 hours, which is significantly more reasonable for an interview challenge. 

In the end, I only needed two of the endpoints to complete the challenge, but I wrote code to support all of them, so that was work I didn't have to do. However, if I wanted to impress an employer and add extra features, some of that work would come in handy.
